# MyCodeIgniter

## MyCodeIgniter.. sounds familiar
Indeed. This was my another web application prototype for CodeIgniter 3.0 and up

## As you can see in my branches
"demo" -- are the samples for using CodeIgniter

## Want to use? Yeah, but it may vary to original one
You may use this one. But you must use CodeIgniter from their original repo to make it clean
